# MovieDB
Project for class "Wyk≈Çad Monograficzny II" about Domain Driven Design, Unit and Integration Testing.

My first approach to create full sized ASP.NET Core MVC project; Other technologies included: Hangfire for scheduled jobs,
EntityFramework for data persistence purposes, MS SQL Server as a db server.

Configure your DB connection in "appsettings.json" file. SQL file for creating DB is available in folder "Prerequisities".
